## Usage Rules

- Apply this front matter to every “official document” (AGENTS, SSOT, PLANS, SKILL, specs, designs, procedures, AI reference topics, etc.).
- Every md under `/docs` or `/knowledge` must include it; `/drafts`, `/notes`, `/scratch`, and similar work logs are exempt.
- Skip it for transient notes or drafts where title/slug/tags/summary would be meaningless noise.
- Consider adding `document_type: "spec" | "guide" | "reference" | "policy" | "concept"` to help AI/human consumers classify the doc.
